1) 
    install all the dependencies: 

    go on backend folder in a terminal
        -> open terminal in the project directory
        -> do command ```cd backend```
    
    flask 
    flask_cors
    pymongo.mongo_client
    from pymongo.server_api

    *if any errors like "cant resolve XXX.." happends, just install that dependency using  ``` pip3 install {name-of-package}``` (or pip is not runnning on pip3)

2)
    connect to database
    go on mongo database
    add you ip address
        -> look on left side bar, scroll down, click on network access, then add your ip address

    connect first to the pymongo vscode extension to see if your able to
    Connection string: mongodb+srv://muizmadadi:ARGNiSSGAKhJjnvv@cluster0.k39ttbn.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0

3)
    open backend first:
    go on backend folder in a terminal
        -> open terminal in the project directory
        -> do command ```cd backend```
    run the app with  the command ```python3 app.py``` (or ```python app.py``` or ```py app.py```)

4) 
    open the frontend:
    go on ANOTHER terminal
    no need to do cd since we are already in the project folder
    run command ```npm start```
        - if npm is not recognized:
            -> you dont have node.js on your computer, go download it from the internet
        - after downloading it npm is still not recognized:
            -> you have it, the path is just not set correctly, search " how to set path environment of npm in my $computer computer " (replace $computer for the machine you are using (MacOs, windows, linux, etc))
    if react-scripts is not found or not recognized:
        - run command ```npm install react-scripts```
        - if the command fails:
            -> run the command again but with --force or --legacy-peer-deps at the end


NOTES: 
    - if you have CORS issue (403), it might be because of 127.0.0.1 in signup or signin.
    - solution: change it to localhost and check again later, the issue takes time to resolve idk why
